# VPNScripts
Bash Scripts to help manage my vpn connections

2 little scripts that I use to help me open and close my openvpn connections.

I place these in $HOME/vpn, but this location can be changed at the top of the "vpn" script.

Under that install directory, there's a directory for each vpn connection.  The name of this directory needs to match the name of the .ovpn file within that directory.

Update your PATH to include the "vpn" script.
